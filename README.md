## About The Project

* This is a Simple Shell project, one of the most anticipated projects in our programming course. The project will challenge us in many ways and will require us to apply everything we have learned so far, including the basics of programming, C language, thinking like an engineer, group work, and learning how to learn.

* The goal of this project is to develop a simple command-line interface (CLI) shell that can execute commands entered by the user. The shell should be able to handle basic commands such as ls, cd, pwd, cp, mv, rm, and others.

* We will be using C language to develop the shell and will be working closely together as a team. Collaborating on this project will help us to improve our coding skills and learn how to work effectively with others on a software development project.

* We are excited to take on this challenge and look forward to learning and growing together as we develop our Simple Shell.

## Built With

This project built with `C programming language`.

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

## Prerequisites

First you need to install the `gcc` compiler in you machine.

To install the GCC compiler on Ubuntu, you can follow these steps:

* Open the terminal on your Ubuntu system by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T.
* Type the following command to update the package list:
```
sudo apt update
```
 * Once the package list is updated, type the following command to install GCC:
```
sudo apt install gcc
```
* This will install the GCC compiler on your Ubuntu system. You can verify the installation by checking the version of GCC installed on your system using the following command:
```
gcc --version
```


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:abdelemjidessaid/simple_shell.git
```

2. Open the repository dir:

```
cd simple_shell
```

3. Compile the project files:

```
gcc *.c -o run
```

4. Run the program:
